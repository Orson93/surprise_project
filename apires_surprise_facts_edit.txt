Put simply, a volcano is an opening (usually in a mountain) in the Earth's surface from which gas, hot magma and ash can escape
The word 'volcano' comes from the Roman name 'Vulcan'
Volcanoes are often found at meeting points of what are called 'tectonic plates'
Volcanoes aren't only found on the boundaries of tectonic plates, though
350 million, or one in 20 people in the world live within 'danger range' of an active volcano
Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant or extinct depending on the amount of volcanic activity happening
When you imagine a volcano, you might picture it as a large, slope-sided mountain, but volcanoes can actually be a variety of shapes
Magma is the name given to hot liquid rock inside a volcano
Volcanoes don't just occur on land, they can be found on the ocean floor and under ice caps, too
Lava can reach 1,250C and has the potential to burn everything in its path
The world's largest active volcano is Mauna Loa in Hawaii standing at 4,169m
The 'Ring of Fire', a 40,000 km Horseshoe shaped area of the Pacific Ocean, is home to 90% of all volcanoes on the Earth
About 1,900 volcanoes on Earth are considered active and are likely to explode again
In 1883 Krakatau in Southeast Asia erupted, releasing 200 megatrons of energy, the equivalent of 15,000 nuclear bombs
The soil near volcanoes is said to be rich and fertile which is why some people actually set up home on the slopes
And it's not just humans that settle on the slopes
